# Smart_Double_Door_System
For my EE212 Microprocessors course, I designed smart double-door system. In this project, I used KL25z Freedom
Board, and as peripherals, I connected the motion sensor, Bluetooth module, 2 Joystick Module, Buzzer, LCD screen,
and two Servo motors. When someone gets close to the door, the alarm activates and gives two options to open the
doors. Doors can be opened by joysticks or smartphone. I coded the project in C language. I get full marks for this
project.
